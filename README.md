# Six-degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon-Assignment

## Description
For the project, we are tasked with creating/implementing the backend for a service that computes "six degrees of Kevin Bacon", which involves finding the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and a given actor through shared movies. We are using tools such as Neoj4, Git, Github, Maven and Java 1.8 for the completion of the project. In Phase I, we have set up the project in our chosen IDE, and submitted a detailed report on team introductions, project goals, application descriptions, new feature identification, endpoint descriptions, testing plans, and screenshots of our setup. In Phase II, we must implement the REST API with the endpoints for adding actors, movies, relationships, and retrieving information or computing paths. We are also required to write tests for each endpoint (one that tests the 200 response and one that tests a 4XX response), ensuring proper response codes for various scenarios.

Our main objectives include implementing a ranking system based on movie ratings (similar to IMDB), adding movie certificate ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R), and allowing users to retrieve lists of movies based on specific years. The project features multiple endpoints to achieve its functionality. For example, the PUT request endpoint /api/v1/addInfo allows the addition of extra movie information such as IMDB ratings, MPAA ratings, and release years. The GET request endpoints facilitate retrieving top-ranked movies (/api/v1/getRank), movies based on MPAA ratings (/api/v1/getMPAA), and movies from specific years (/api/v1/getYear). Each endpoint is designed to handle specific requests with appropriate responses and error handling for various edge cases. To ensure accuracy, we will conduct testing by inserting sample movies into an empty database and comparing the outputs against pre-sorted lists.
